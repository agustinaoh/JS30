    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;
    // team[2] = 'Joe'
    console.log(players);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    const team2 = [...players];
    team2[2] = 'Greg';

    const team3 = players.slice();
    team3[2] = 'Sophie';

    const team4 = [].concat(players);
    team4[0] = 'Mindy';

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'Lulu';

    console.log(players, team, team2, team3, team4, team5);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const person2 = person;
    // person2['name'] = 'Holu';

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    
    const person3 = Object.assign({}, person);
    person3['age'] = 5;
    
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
